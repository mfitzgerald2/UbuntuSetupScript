# UbuntuSetupScript
This script is a bash script to run on a freshly installed Ubuntu system that will automatically upgrade the current system to the newest release as well as remove all of the 'bloatware', or unwanted programs that come along with a default Ubuntu install. 

# How to Use

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfitzgerald2/UbuntuSetupScript/master/USS.sh`

Make sure you have permissions to run it... 
`chmod 700 USS.sh`

Run it...
`./USS.sh`
